This is the final project made during my internship in [Technocolabs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/technocolabs/). In this project, we were given a two files, a CSV file containing data about music track title, composer, label and many other features including track genre. The JSON file consist of techincal details about a sound track including valence and dacebility.

We were given the task to build a classifier for this dataset which was highly unbalanced and then deploying that model to any of the cloud services.
